Before there is any successful restaurant there is a concept. A concept can be rock solid, born from years of vision, or it can evolve as the project grows. It can be driven by the menu, a location, a piece of art, a time period, or a sense of place. Sometimes it is very concrete and specific and sometimes it is vague and esoteric. In any case, a strong conceptual identity is imperative to creating a successful design. It informs every design decision and creates a consistent identity.
