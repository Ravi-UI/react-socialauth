Cutting energy consumption not only helps out Mother Nature, but could also reduce your monthly bills by a significant amount. If your restaurant is already open try replacing those power-hog incandescent light bulbs for energy-sipping LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes). If you’re in the process of opening a new place, try installing a VAV (Variable Air Volume) mechanical system for your kitchen hoods. These systems power down when the burners are not in use, saving energy twofold. Once, by not needing as much juice as when you’re constantly running the hoods, and twice, by not sucking up all the conditioned air. (Stay tuned for more information on these systems)"}],"asset":null,"style":"normal"},{"_key":"8d428a813e3b","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"8d428a813e3b0","_type":"span","text":"Social responsibility"},{"_key":"8d428a813e3b1","_type":"span","text":".
